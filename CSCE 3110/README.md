### Course Details 
Name: Data Structures and Algorithms  
Completed: May 2020  

### Note
These programs were created for extra credit, and are very simple. They basically only demonstrate knowledge of C++ syntax. In this class, I also wrote code for several standard data structures (AVL Trees, Heaps, etc); however, a significant portion of those assignments was pre-coded, so my own work was interspersed through others' work and I did not find it suitable for uploading.
